{"name":"PushTorrent","tagline":"Get torrent notifications in your inbox [alpha] // Sinatra app","body":"# PushTorrent\r\n\r\nBuilt with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) 2.2.1, [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) 1.4.5 and [Nokogiri](http://www.nokogiri.org/) 1.6.5.\r\n\r\n### Description of the web app's basic functionality\r\nPushTorrent lets users opt-in to receive email notifications when named new torrents of choice are ready for download. No need to do frequent manual searches for newly released torrents, e.g. 'ruby on rails', 'the stranger 720p HD', 'FLAC' or similar.   \r\n\r\nWhy not get an email when the torrents you seek are released?\r\n\r\n## Join this project\r\nAll help is welcome. I'm glad to share this project with any interested contributors; newbie, experienced, young and old, english-speaking or english-trying. Contribute as you best can. That would perhaps be [correcting typos or similar](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/24-pull-requests) and submitting a [pull request](http://readwrite.com/2014/07/02/github-pull-request-etiquette) as detailed on the friendly, but easily over-stimulating pull request [walk-through](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) on Github. \r\n\r\nTry it - and you have started collaborating! \r\n\r\n#### To-do list?\r\nSure. Check the [to-do](https://github.com/frankblob/pushtorrent/blob/master/TODO.md) file. \r\n\r\nOkay, that's it, I guess. \r\n\r\n**Stay cheerful**","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
