{"name":"PushTorrent","tagline":"Get torrent notifications in your inbox [alpha] // Sinatra app","body":"# Welcome to 'PushTorrent' \r\n\r\nBuilt with Ruby 2.2.1, [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) 1.4.5 and [Nokogiri](http://www.nokogiri.org/) 1.6.5.\r\n\r\n### Description of the web app's basic functionality\r\nPushTorrent lets users opt-in to receive email notifications when named new torrents of choice are ready for download. No need to do frequent manual searches for newly released torrents, e.g. 'ruby on rails', 'the stranger 720p HD', 'FLAC' or similar.   \r\n\r\nWhy not get an email when the torrents you seek are released?\r\n\r\n#### To-do list?\r\nSure. Check the [to-do](https://github.com/frankblob/pushtorrent/blob/master/TODO.md) file. \r\n\r\n##### Ruby questions I currently wonder about... \r\n1. When do instance variables 'die'? Trying to understand the memory usage of Ruby apps...\r\n2. Is it worth it to manually set an instance variable = nil, when no longer in use? Or will Ruby GC do it for me?\r\n3. Why is GC for symbols great? Should I use symbols more and thereby, as a consequence, optimize the memory usage of the app?\r\n4. Will performance and memory utilization improve by replacing Nokogiri with Ox, Oga or even [Curb](https://rubygems.org/gems/curb), in terms of installed gems alone? Not focucing on the performance of the individual gems (Nokogori vs Ox parsing, for instance), but the number, dependencies and size of installed gems.\r\n5. Is it necessary to implement something akin to [referential integrity](https://github.com/orcasnet/activerecord-referential_integrity) for foreign keys in Sequel? Have done check and delete on \"zero associations\" in Sequel for now.\r\n\r\n## Join this project\r\nAll help is welcome. I'm glad to share this project with any interested contributors; newbie, experienced, young and old, english-speaking or english-trying. Contribute as you best can. That would perhaps be [correcting typos or similar](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/24-pull-requests) and submitting a [pull request](http://readwrite.com/2014/07/02/github-pull-request-etiquette) as detailed on the friendly, but easily over-stimulating pull request [walk-through](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) on Github. \r\n\r\nTry it - and you have started collaborating! \r\n\r\nOkay, that's it, I guess. \r\n\r\n**Stay cheerful**","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
