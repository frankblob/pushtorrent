#Welcome to 'Torrent Watch' 
## AKA 'contributions/name suggestions are welcome'

Built with Ruby 2.2.0, Sinatra 1.4.5 and Nokogiri 1.6.5.

### Description of the web app's basic functionality
No need for users to manually do daily torrent searches for new 'ruby on rails', 'the stranger 720p HD', 'FLAC' or similar. Torrent Watch let users search and opt-in to receive email notifications when new torrents are ready for download.  

Why not get an email when the torrents you seek are released?

##### Roadmap / to-do list for future functionality and features

1. Timedate sorted torrent list, but allowing user to do size and seeders.
2. Dynamically generate static pages for notification search terms
  -Include site map, with updated child nodes.
3. Add bootstrap and design the layout with clear CTA
4. Add DB for user registration and user management of notifications
	-Sign up
	-Log in
	-Manage notifications
5. Develop function for daily querying of notification search terms
	-Dynamically generate emails when new releases are found
		--Update timedate field for notification, to secure only new releases are searched
6. Install user forum
	-Reuse user DB, to avoid double sign up
7. Produce simple instructional video for home page
8. Generate email template and create example email for viewing

##### About me
The project described above seems more complex than doable, but my goal is to hack away and learn as much as possible.  

In short I'm a nobody, newbie and non-programmer dabbling in my first attempts at Ruby, object-oriented programming and GitHub. This is my first web application attempt other than auto-deploying a RailsBricks app, since I could not get anything self-made to work on Heroku :)

###### Ruby questions I currently wonder about... 
1. Does instance variables use more memory than regular variables?
2. Is it worth it to manually set @variable = nil, when no longer in use - or will Ruby GC do it for me?
