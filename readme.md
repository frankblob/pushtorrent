#Welcome to 'Torrent Watch'

1. Built with Ruby 2.2.0
  Sinatra 1.4.5
    Nokogiri 1.6.5.

Planning to integrate Twitter Bootstrap during next phases.

###Basic functionality of the web app
Users search for torrents and opt-in to be notified via email once new torrents for their search term becomes available. No need to manually do daily searches for new releases on specific interests, such as "ruby on rails". 

Why not get an email when something like that is released the next time?

###### About me
The project described above seems more complex than doable, but my goal is to hack away and learn as much as possible.  

In short I'm a nobody, newbie and non-programmer dabbling in my first attempts at Ruby, object-oriented programming and GitHub. This is my first web application attempt other than auto-deploying a RailsBricks app, since I could not get anything self-made to work on Heroku :)

###My current questions are 
1. Does instance variables use more memory than regular variables?
2. Is it worth it to manually set @variable = nil, when no longer in use - or will Ruby GC do it for me?

##Join this project
All help is welcome. I'm glad to share this project with any interested contributors.


Okay, that's it, I guess. 

Stay cheerful.
