Built with Ruby 2.2.0, Sinatra 1.4.5, Nokogiri 1.6.5.

Planning to integrate Twitter Bootstrap during next phases.

The basic idea is for users to search for torrents and be notified via email once there are new releases for their particular search term. So you can be updated once new releases become available, instead of going to manually search for your new releases daily on specific interests, such as "ruby on rails". Why not get an update when something like that is released the next time.

I'm a nobody, newbie and non-programmer dabbling in my first attempts at Ruby, object-oriented programming and GitHub. This is my first web application attempt other than deploying a RailsBricks app :)

All help is welcome. I'm glad to share this project with any interested contributors.

Okay, that's it for a first version readme, I guess. 

Stay cheerful.
